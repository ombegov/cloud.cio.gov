# CIO Council Actions

To be **Cloud Smart**, agencies will consider how to extend their
current resources to maximize value, by reskilling and retraining staff,
enhancing security postures, and using best practices for purchasing. By
leveraging modern technologies and practices appropriate to their
missions, agencies will be able to harness new capabilities and expand
existing abilities to deliver services to the public.

The Chief Information Officers Council has created the following list of
action items as concrete steps that will be taken over the next 18 months
to accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. The Office of
Management and Budget, the General Services Administration,
and other agency partners will undertake these actions while continuing
to evolve and improve upon the strategy using lessons learned during
these tasks.
