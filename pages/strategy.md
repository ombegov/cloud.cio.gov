# <a id="cloud-smart"></a>From Cloud First to Cloud Smart

In the *Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization*, released
publicly in 2017 in accordance with Executive Order 13800,[^1] the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pledged to update the Government's
legacy Federal Cloud Computing Strategy ("Cloud First"). Fulfilling this
promise, the Administration has developed a new strategy to accelerate
agency adoption of cloud-based solutions: **Cloud Smart**.

Developed nearly a decade after its predecessor, Cloud Smart equips
agencies with actionable information and recommendations gleaned from
some of the country's most impactful public and private sector use
cases.[^2] Beyond Cloud First, which granted agencies broad authority to
adopt cloud-based solutions, Cloud Smart offers practical implementation
guidance for Government missions to fully actualize the promise and
potential of cloud-based technologies while ensuring thoughtful
execution that incorporates practical realities.

The new strategy is founded on three key pillars of successful cloud
adoption: **security**, **procurement**, and **workforce**.
Collectively, these elements embody the interdisciplinary approach to IT
modernization that the Federal enterprise needs in order to provide
improved return on its investments, enhanced security, and higher
quality services to the American people.

## <a id="key-actions"></a>Key Actions

The Chief Information Officers Council (CIO Council) has developed a
list of action items to execute the Cloud Smart strategy. These actions
will constitute a work plan aimed at creating and updating programs,
policies, and resources that the whole of Government will use to advance
the Cloud Smart agenda.

Additionally, all Federal agencies will rationalize their application
portfolios to drive Federal cloud adoption. The rationalization process
will involve reducing an application portfolio by 1) assessing the need
for and usage of applications; and 2) discarding obsolete, redundant, or
overly resource-intensive applications. Decreased application management
responsibilities will free agencies to focus on improving service
delivery by optimizing their remaining applications.

To support these rationalization efforts, the CIO Council will develop
best practices and other resources. Furthermore, while the initial Cloud
Smart work plan will be executed over an eighteen-month period, its
actions will be refreshed continuously as needed to keep up with the
changing cloud market and emerging technologies.

# <a id="cloud-at-a-glance"></a>I. Cloud at a Glance

## Redefining Cloud Computing

The term "cloud" is often used broadly in the Federal Government for any
technology solution provided by an outside vendor. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined several cloud
deployment models as progressive increases in management by vendors,
from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) where vendors provide the
infrastructure and hardware, to Platform as a Service (PaaS) where
vendors provide a managed environment for a customer's application, to
Software as a Service (SaaS) where vendors provide a fully managed
application and customers need only supply their data. In practice, many
major vendor offerings no longer have such well-defined boundaries.
Notwithstanding the term's common usage, the term "cloud" is most
accurately applied to those solutions that exhibit five essential
characteristics of cloud computing, as defined by NIST: on-demand
service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and
measured service.[^3]

These characteristics and the solutions that exhibit them are
provider-agnostic -- meaning anyone can develop and deploy a cloud
solution, whether an outside vendor or a Federal agency. Industry has
moved to a more finely differentiated set of capabilities offered at
different system layers, making possible nearly any combination of
various components managed by either a vendor, a Government agency, or a
mix of both. Industries that are leading in technology innovation have
also demonstrated that hybrid and multi-cloud environments can be
effective and efficient for managing workloads. As a result, the Cloud
Smart Strategy encourages agencies to think of cloud as an array of
solutions that offer many capabilities and management options to enhance
mission and service delivery.

Furthermore, Cloud Smart operates on the principle that agencies should
be equipped to evaluate their options based on their service and mission
needs, technical requirements, and existing policy limitations.
Computing and technology decisions should also consider customer impact
balanced against cost and cybersecurity risk management criteria.
Additionally, agencies need to weigh the long-term inefficiencies of
migrating applications as-is into cloud environments against the
immediate financial costs of modernizing in advance or replacing them
altogether.

Cloud adoption strategies that successfully meet the intent of Cloud
Smart should not be developed around the question of who owns which
resources or what anticipated cost savings exist. Instead, agencies
should assess their requirements and seek the environments and
solutions, cloud or otherwise, that best enable them to achieve their
mission goals while being good stewards of taxpayer resources.

## Modernization and Maturity

To realize the full benefit of cloud technology, agencies must cultivate
an organizational mindset of constant improvement and learning.
Modernization is not a commitment that is sustained solely by
interventions once every decade. Rather, modernization is a constant
state of change and part of the day-to-day business of technology at
every agency. Critical to fostering this mindset of constant improvement
is agency leadership's prioritization of the training and education of
their staff, detailed and comprehensive migration planning, and a focus
on balancing solution sustainability with the incorporation of new
capabilities into agency operating environments. To that end, agencies
will need to iteratively improve policies, technical guidance, and
business requirements to match changing needs, drive positive outcomes,
and prevent their IT portfolio from becoming obsolete.

Agencies should conduct regular evaluations of customer experience and
user needs to ensure that their solutions successfully foster
efficiency, accessibility, and privacy.[^4] Additionally, agencies
should regularly rationalize and update their applications, migrating as
needed, to reduce the risk of large-scale failure, better allocate their
resources, and provide staff with adequate time to become familiar with
contemporary product management techniques. Agencies must also track
their growth in areas where decisions about technology intersect other
disciplines. Namely, serious consideration and investment should be
dedicated to the three key pillars of successful cloud adoption:
**security, procurement,** and **workforce.**

Given the distributed nature of cloud and the growing number of discrete
capabilities and deployment models available to choose from, agencies
might consider moving or adding security and privacy controls to the
data layer itself, rather than just where they have historically resided
at the network perimeter. By doing so, agencies can improve their
overall security and privacy posture, empowering them to fully embrace
cloud technologies while granting them peace of mind that the
confidentiality and integrity of their data are intact.

To realize not only the security benefits of cloud infrastructure, but
also its benefits related to scalability and speed-to-market, agencies
should utilize mature agile development practices, including DevSecOps.
The use of automated and assistive technologies such as artificial
intelligence and machine learning can help agencies to further improve
security. Agencies should also review their IT portfolios regularly to
determine modernization plans for existing tools and compare potential
service offerings designated as Best In Class (BIC) solutions for
maximized return on investment.

Furthermore, providing staff with training and other educational
resources is essential to fostering maturity in the areas of privacy,
security, and procurement. Agency IT staff should become familiar with
lean product management, agile development, continuous delivery, and
automated infrastructure at the team and program level as part of any
modernization plan. Additionally, non-IT staff supporting privacy,
security, and procurement should receive training in the multiple core
disciplines outlined above. Sustained progress in these areas of staff
training is foundational to the successful implementation of new cloud
efforts.

Consistent with the requirements of the Federal Information Technology
Acquisition Reform Act,[^5] the agency Chief Information Officer (CIO)
should oversee modernization processes to help find opportunities for
enterprise-wide improvement. Additional involvement of the Chief
Financial Officer can help properly budget for planning, evaluation, and
technology adoption. CIOs should also incorporate feedback from business
units and end users affected by modernization projects to minimize
disruption to mission delivery.

# <a id="security"></a>II. Security

Agencies should take a risk-based approach to securing cloud
environments. As recommended by the *Report to the President on Federal
IT Modernization*, agencies should emphasize "data-level protections and
fully leverage modern virtualized technologies."[^6] This requires that
agencies place an emphasis on protections at the data layer in addition
to the network and physical infrastructure layers, transitioning to a
multi-layer defense strategy, otherwise known as defense-in-depth.

Critical to the success of this security strategy in the context of
Cloud Smart is the assurance of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of Federal information as it traverses networks and rests
within systems, regardless of whether those environments are managed
locally, off-premises, by a Government entity, or by a contractor.
Additionally, it is essential that agencies perform continuous
monitoring to detect malicious activity and dedicate effort to improving
systems governance.

Successfully managing cloud adoption risks requires collaboration
between agency leadership, mission owners, technology practitioners, and
governance bodies. Coordination between information security and privacy
programs is necessary to ensure compliance with applicable privacy
requirements and for the successful identification and management of
risks to individuals when processing personally identifiable information
(PII).[^7] Senior Agency Officials for Privacy (SAOPs)[^8] are
responsible for managing the risk that may result from the creation,
collection, use, and retention of PII, and have an important role to
play when making decisions about the adoption of technology and
processes that concern or impact the management of PII.

**Cloud Smart** encourages agencies to approach security and privacy in
terms of intended outcomes and capabilities. The following programs are
major elements of the Federal security strategy that must evolve
alongside technological progress to allow agencies to take such a
holistic and outcome-driven approach.

## Trusted Internet Connections

Released in 2007, OMB Memorandum M-08-05[^9] established new
requirements for Federal agencies with the intent to reduce the
Federal-wide number of external network connections while standardizing
their security. Since the policy's release, agency network traffic in
compliance with OMB requirements has flown exclusively through a limited
number of external connections, known as Trusted Internet Connections
(TICs). While this initial architectural concept served an important
purpose at its inception, at a time when networking was constrained by
physical limitations and agency approaches to network security were not
standardized and highly fragmented, the technology landscape has evolved
to provide agencies with more tools, technologies, and approaches to
secure their data, leaving the once-useful TIC construct now relatively
inflexible and incompatible with many agencies' requirements. With the
proliferation of private-sector cloud offerings, the emergence of
software-defined networks, and an increasingly mobile workforce, the TIC
model must compete with newer, more flexible solutions that provide
equal or greater security, or it must evolve as well.

Electing the latter option, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is
working with various agencies to pilot agency-specific approaches that
meet the objectives and intent of M-08-05 while minimizing technical
constraints posed by the policy's one-size-fits-all TIC model. These
newer, less rigid approaches will be incorporated into updated TIC
Reference Architectures to highlight use cases wherein security
objectives can be met without routing all traffic through a prescribed
set of physical access points. The TIC Reference Architectures will also
demonstrate how different use cases that do not require traffic to be
routed through a TIC can address the requirements for government-wide
intrusion detection and prevention efforts, such as the EINSTEIN Program
while also incorporating DHS-designated controls, which have been
designed to ensure a baseline level of security across the Federal
enterprise.[^10]

By taking these actions to expand the options available to agencies to
secure their networks and data, the collective ability of the Federal
Government to take advantage of new paradigms, such as zero trust
networks, is heightened, as its effectiveness in managing risk.

## Continuous Data Protection and Awareness

Given the ease of flow of federally-owned data from internal networks to
external, end-user devices, encryption and modern Identity, Credential,
and Access Management (ICAM) implementation is essential. Encryption and
ICAM implementation is particularly relevant in the context of
cloud-based environments, namely in those instances where an agency is
partnering with an external service provider to manage network
visibility and data protection.

To ensure continuity of information security during and after the
migration process, it is incumbent upon agencies to thoroughly assess
their operational, policy, and business requirements and advocate for
themselves when brokering new arrangements with cloud service providers.
Regardless of provider type -- commercial or Federal -- agencies should
consider having agreements in place with all providers regarding access
to, and use of, log data given its importance in effectively conducting
information security operations. Moreover, as each agency is the
custodian of its information on behalf of the public, each agency is
responsible for determining its own governance model for cloud-hosted
data that aligns with its identity and credential management systems. To
that end, where a cloud solution is deployed by a vendor, a Service
Level Agreement (SLA) should be in place that provides the agency with
continuous awareness of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of its information.

Furthermore, agencies should be made aware if their information will
reside on a third-party information system prior to signing any service
agreement; agencies should be provided continuous access to log data;
and must be notified promptly if a cybersecurity incident, breach, [^11]
or other adverse event occurs or is suspected to have occurred that
involves any information or information systems covered by a service
agreement with a cloud service provider.

To further enable continuous data protection and awareness, agencies and
their partners should regularly engage in reciprocal information
sharing. Cybersecurity requires public-private collaboration, and as
more Federal entities adopt commercial cloud solutions, customers and
providers should work together to protect information. Recognizing the
criticality of tools and analytical capabilities that scale across
multi-cloud environments in the facilitation of continuous visibility
and information sharing, DHS's Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation
(CDM) Program[^12] also continues to evolve so that agencies are
equipped with the monitoring capabilities they need to understand their
cyber risk in the cloud.

## FedRAMP

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) provides
a standardized government-wide approach to security assessment,
authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud services. Offering
cloud service providers the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to
meet Federal security requirements through standardized baselines has
allowed for a flourishing marketplace of vetted providers to develop. It
has also allowed agencies to adapt from arcane legacy technology to
mission-centric and cost-effective cloud-based systems in a more rapid,
consistent, and secure manner.

Although the FedRAMP program management office has drastically reduced
the amount of time it takes to authorize a cloud service provider, there
is still work to be done to address the underlying issues that
contribute to the relatively slow pace of assessment. For example, a
lack of reciprocity across agencies when adopting FedRAMP authorizations
has led to significant duplication of effort when assessing security for
product deployment. In addition, a large number of agency-specific
processes has made it complicated for agencies to issue an Authorization
to Operate (ATO) for solutions, even when using existing authorized
cloud service providers. In fact, despite the reiterated importance of
enterprise risk management,[^13] agencies continue to cite major
obstacles with their own policies and practices.

To tackle these challenges, several initiatives aimed at overall process
evolution as well as strategies for accelerating common ATO agreements
are under development. These efforts intend to drive better and more
automated control inheritance and monitoring, a prioritized approach to
control implementation, and more normalized control use across the
Federal enterprise. Advancements to cloud ATO development will be used
to inform overall ATO reform, which will involve the revision of NIST
special publications. This will also reestablish FedRAMP's role in the
risk assessment process as a verification check for agencies as they
make informed decisions about the cloud solutions that they deploy,
rather than a panacea for all matters related to the risk associated
with any implementation of a cloud solution. OMB and GSA will continue
to promote alignment and reuse of ATO determinations and closely examine
agency-identified obstacles in that effort.

Finally, enhancing the skillsets of the Federal workforce around cloud
security in the FedRAMP program will allow the Federal Government to
continue to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of agency security
practices in adopting cloud systems, while reducing the burden on
security professionals, providers, and agency leadership. Assembling a
cadre of professionals and providing direct engagement with all aspects
of the security authorization process will build a common and
comprehensive understanding of cloud security and enable more trust when
sharing ATOs. Agencies are also encouraged to take a multidisciplinary
approach to hiring and training their workforce, as well as provide
community spaces where digital services experts, information security
professionals, procurement specialists, and others with a mutual
interest in effective, secure cloud adoption can collaborate on current
challenges and opportunities in the cloud computing space.

# <a id="procurement"></a>III. Procurement

Industry partners, interagency working groups, and individual agencies
have provided the Federal IT and acquisition communities with a wide
selection of recommended actions to accelerate the adoption of cloud
solutions. Some of these recommendations have been translated into
Federal-wide guidance, but there remains a lack of consistency across
agency implementations and information sharing on best practices. In the
absence of comprehensive guidance, agencies must search across multiple
sources to gain a basic understanding of the various types of cloud
services sold in the commercial marketplace, the different offerings
available on existing government-wide contracts, and the best way to
evaluate which approach is best for a given requirement.

As a result of ubiquitous private sector use of cloud computing,
agencies often purchase services through contracts that, while not
specifically marketed as a cloud-based service or capability, involve
placement of agency information into cloud-based systems for processing
or storage. This trend creates potential security and privacy concerns
and warrants that agencies pay greater attention to professional
services contracts, where the storage of Federal information on
non-Government information systems may be implied.

To address these challenges, agencies will need to use a variety of
approaches that leverage the strength of Federal Government's bulk
purchasing power, the shared knowledge of good acquisition principles,
as well as relevant risk management practices. As part of the Cloud
Smart multidisciplinary approach, agencies will also need to place
security and privacy considerations at the forefront of any procurement
effort, and to avoid vendor lock-in, they should evaluate the business
process dependencies of any new solution. They should also update their
business continuity and disaster recovery plans to include contingencies
involving the sudden interruption or termination of service. Detailed
below are additional considerations for Federal procurement
professionals navigating the IT space and IT professionals seeking
guidance on common practices to ensure the cost-effective, safeguarded
procurement of cloud-based solutions.

## Category Management

Category management describes the strategic business practice that the
Federal Government is implementing to buy smarter and more like a single
enterprise. Specifically, government-wide category management aims to:
1) deliver more savings, value, and efficiency for Federal agencies; 2)
eliminate unnecessary contract redundancies; and 3) meet the
Government's small business goals.

Category management simplifies the process for industry to do business
with the Government by reducing duplicative contracts and
decreasing costs for bids, proposals, and contract administration. It
also offers the Federal Government the opportunity to improve buying
practices that support Cloud Smart strategies, increase adoption of
proven cloud vehicles in the Federal marketplace, and develop new
vehicles to address emerging demands. OMB has published a
memorandum[^14] that outlines guidance on the implementation of category
management principles and use of common contract solutions.

## Service Level Agreements

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a customer and a service
provider defines the level of performance expected from a service
provider, how that performance will be measured, and what enforcement
mechanisms will be used to ensure the specified levels are achieved.
While not standardized in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),[^15]
SLAs are incorporated through contract clauses and quality assurance
contractual provisions. In legacy technology environments, these
agreements represent a critical element of negotiation with suppliers.
Unfortunately, the term "Service Level Agreement" itself has become
overloaded with multiple meanings depending on context, which has
resulted in increased uncertainty around the best approach to achieve
better outcomes for agencies. Cloud Smart offers a two-track approach to
smarter cloud purchasing and usage across Federal agencies through
improvements to SLA use, as outlined below.

First, it is important to note that candidates for inclusion as standard
clauses that apply to commercial items in the FAR -- including new SLAs
-- must generally meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) the
clause is required to implement a provision of law applicable to the
acquisition of commercial items; or (2) the clause is generally
consistent with customary commercial practice. Keeping these
stipulations in mind, the first track of activities to support the
effective use of SLAs involve the government-wide review and selection
of contractual terms and conditions specific to cloud-based commercial
offerings that are good candidates for standardized use across agencies.
Standardizing cloud contract SLAs will provide more effective,
efficient, and secure cloud procurement outcomes for agencies, while
also enabling enhanced management of risk across the Federal enterprise
through greater consistency and transparency in negotiations with
commercial suppliers.

Second, heads of executive agencies are accountable for managing the
risk to their enterprises, and that responsibility remains with the
agency head even with respect to contractor-operated systems. An
important element of acquiring cloud services is clarity in what
services a cloud provider performs and at what level. Therefore, to
facilitate effective risk management by way of their relationships with
commercial cloud service providers, agencies should granularly
articulate roles and responsibilities, establish clear performance
metrics, and implement remediation plans for non-compliance. Such
governance, architecture, and operational clarity would help ensure that
services are performed as intended, and, when paired with the right SLA
language, would offer agencies a way to mitigate risk while optimizing
the performance and efficiency of their newly procured cloud-based
solution.

## Security Requirements for Contracts

It is essential that agencies consider and manage security and privacy
risk to information and mission services when making cloud procurement
and deployment decisions. Incorporating this approach as part of the
acquisitions process and system development lifecycle, the Federal CIO
has published an updated High Value Asset (HVA) memorandum[^16] that
builds on the previous initiative and adds considerations for managing
risk across hybrid environments. Agencies must now ensure that contracts
impacting their HVAs, including those managed and operated in the cloud,
include requirements that provide agencies with continuous visibility of
the asset. The guidance enables agencies to proactively assess the
security and privacy posture of their assets and seeks to increase HVA
trustworthiness by requiring developers, manufacturers, and vendors to
employ best practices for designing, deploying, and securing systems.
This will drive a targeted integration of security and privacy design
principles, secure coding techniques, and trusted computing methods.

# <a id="workforce"></a>IV. Workforce

The Federal IT workforce plays an integral role in the execution of
agency missions, delivery of services to the public, and provision of
security to the nation's essential systems and information. In the same
way that agencies cannot outsource risk to commercial suppliers, neither
can they outsource decision-making. Agencies' immediate and sustained
investment in the Federal workforce is critical to the enhanced quality,
security, and impact of services delivered to taxpayers. Without it,
improvements to the Federal Government's technology infrastructure, and
the successful proliferation of the Cloud Smart strategy will not be
fully realized.

As agencies adopt and migrate to cloud platforms, the impact that these
migrations have on the Federal workforce needs to be examined.
Specifically, agencies should identify potential skills gaps that emerge
as a result of a transition to cloud-based services, and, where needed,
equip their existing staff with additional skills and knowledge to keep
up with the ever-expanding list of technology options available to
procure and deploy.

Agencies should not restrict themselves to a single model for workforce
transformation. Strategies might include development programs for
emerging talent or future leaders; apprenticeship programs; initiatives
to convert non-IT personnel where aptitudes align; or exchanges of
qualified personnel through public-private partnerships or interagency
detail opportunities. Generally, agencies' cloud strategies and policies
should also include a workforce development and planning component that
tailors a transformation and training approach to that agency.
Additionally, in the event that an impact to the existing workforce has
been identified, this approach should include a cross-walk of new skills
and occupational categories with legacy occupational categories to
foster clarity and ease of transition.

## Identifying Skill Gaps for Current and Future Work Roles

Successful adoption of cloud solutions requires a workforce that
understands how to manage the complexities of a migration as well as how
to support a cloud environment once fully deployed. Agency CIOs, Chief
Human Capital Officers (CHCOs), and SAOPs should collaboratively conduct
a skills gap analysis that maps current IT workforce resources to future
skill and position requirements. Agencies are strongly encouraged to
leverage industry projections to help predict future workforce skill and
position requirements, especially for IT roles.

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity
Workforce Framework, whose use by Federal agencies is mandated in the
Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015[^17], recommends
an approach for identifying all Federal civilian positions performing IT
or cybersecurity-related functions.[^18] While Federal agencies should
continue to comply with the NICE Framework to help standardize
government-wide cybersecurity workforce gap assessments, they are
encouraged to conduct their own enterprise-wide skills gap analysis to
ensure inclusion of all current and future IT skills and positions
specific to their workforce requirements.

## Reskilling and Retaining Current Federal Employees

Current employees may lack the skills or knowledge required to
facilitate a cloud migration or to maintain the environment once
migrated. Therefore, agencies must conduct their skills gap analysis to
identify both technical and non-technical skill and position gaps so
that leadership may determine which deficiencies are the most
significant and/or represent a critical mission need.

Agencies should address the most pressing deficits found by a workforce
gap analysis by developing employee reskilling strategies that focus on
training and professional development opportunities, such as OMB's
Digital Information Technology Acquisition Professional (DITAP)
program.[^19] A complete reskilling strategy will account for technical
as well as non-technical needs. Given that cloud computing is relatively
new territory for acquisition professionals, such as Chief Acquisition
Officers, Contracting Officers, and Project Managers, should take
advantage of existing guidance from resources such as the OMB, the
Federal Acquisition Institute,[^20] and the TechFAR HUB.[^21] Consistent
with guidance for IT acquisition roles, agencies may also benefit from
developing a specialized team or expanding the use of IT acquisition
cadres.[^22]

Lastly, CHCOs and Chief Learning Officers should help determine optimal
training and redeployment options (e.g., certification and rotational
programs) to utilize reskilled employees. As with many new technology
initiatives, agencies should expect an aggressive initial training
period and should also plan for ongoing education and experimentation in
this rapidly evolving field. Providing valuable employees access to
continuing education resources and opportunities to apply their
knowledge will both inform new cloud initiatives and promote job
satisfaction.

Above all else, the success of initiatives like these is dependent on
the support of champions in executive leadership who broadly vocalize
their backing of the effort and who remove roadblocks that discourage or
prevent employees from pursuing reskilling or certification
opportunities. While finding the right champion presents its own
challenges, the ability of this person to amplify the reach and results
of the agency's initiative is invaluable.

## Recruiting and Hiring to Address Skill Gaps

The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that
cloud computing is a major factor in technology occupation growth, which
is projected to expand 13% from 2016 to 2026.[^23] In addition to
reskilling current employees to address the most critical skill and
position gaps, agencies should continuously evaluate and update their
recruitment and hiring strategies. Key strategies include leveraging
industry recruitment best practices, expanding the use of pay
flexibilities, and removing bureaucratic barriers to hiring staff
expeditiously. Agencies must build a pipeline to continuously feed
cybersecurity and IT talent into the Federal Government.

The market for technology professionals with cloud computing skill sets
is extremely competitive. When possible, agencies should leverage
techniques used by the private sector to attract and hire the best
candidates to the Federal Government. In coordination with their Chief
Human Capital Officers, agencies should execute proactive recruitment
and retention strategies such as:

-   Attending industry conferences with career fairs;

-   Holding national hiring events to strengthen awareness and outreach;

-   Developing "most wanted" talent advertisements to showcase critical
    needs;

-   Ensuring that job postings on places like USAJOBS properly reflect
    needed skills;

-   Engaging candidates through social media platforms;

-   Profiling and sharing current employee experiences;

-   Offering incentives to employees for relevant professional
    development;

-   Supporting engagement of Federal employees in appropriate industry
    forums to increase visibility and access;

-   Leveraging merit promotion hiring procedures to retain, promote, or
    redeploy current Federal employees when appropriate;

-   Leveraging hiring and retention authorities approved by the Office
    of Personnel Management, such as incentive pay and awards;

-   Leveraging Scholarship for Service and other academic partnership to
    build a pipeline for graduates into the Federal Government; and

-   Showcasing diversity and inclusion initiatives.

While the Government invests in efforts to recruit existing talent to
the Federal workforce, it should also build a talent pipeline to expand
the pool of qualified applicants. Through the Workforce Council, Federal
Privacy Council, and the Chief Information Officer Council initiatives,
the Government will continue to develop partnerships with community
colleges, apprenticeship programs, and four-year institutions, in
addition to leveraging partnerships that already exist. Expanded
consideration of reskilling and upskilling solutions should be included
in agency transition strategies as well.

## Employee Communication, Engagement, and Transition Strategies

As agencies implement the Cloud Smart strategy, they should execute
communication plans that help employees understand the changes that will
occur. For example, migration to the cloud may require decommissioning
legacy systems that have been in use for many years. Employees may feel
reluctant, especially if positions will be redefined, to learn to
operate new systems in a cloud environment. Agencies can ease workforce
concerns by clearly articulating how the current workforce will align
once cloud adoption is complete. Socializing a technology roadmap to
include systems that will be migrating to the cloud, either completely
or partially, and an outline of the change management process to include
reskilling opportunities is strongly recommended. Agencies should also
feel comfortable leveraging vendors involved in cloud migration
activities to provide or support training for current employees.

## Removing Bureaucratic Barriers to Hiring Talent Expeditiously

The demand for technology professionals with cloud computing skills sets
is at an all-time high. This means that attracting, recruiting, and
retaining the right individuals will take an executable human capital
strategy with a streamlined hiring process and non-traditional
incentives. Agencies with aggressive hiring timelines and competitive
offers leveraging pay and recruitment incentives will attract talent. It
is imperative for agency leadership to identify and promptly address
bureaucratic barriers that hinder agencies from hiring talent in an
expeditious manner.

Agencies have broad authorities under Title 5 of the United States Code
to hire top IT and cybersecurity talent, and to provide candidates with
superior qualifications or who address critical skill gaps with pay
flexibilities and incentives. Agencies are strongly encouraged to use
available hiring authorities, recruitment incentives, and student loan
repayment benefits to hire professionals with highly sought-after cloud
computing skills.

It is incumbent upon Federal agencies to ensure that their current and
future workforce is prepared to support Federal cloud environments.
Agency cloud strategies and commensurate workforce investments should
enable leaders to develop and empower the IT and cybersecurity workforce
with the skills required to achieve cloud migration goals and support
the latest technology that will improve delivery of critical citizen
services.

# <a id="conclusion"></a>V. Conclusion

To be Cloud Smart, agencies must consider how to use their current
resources to maximize value: reskilling and retraining staff, enhancing
security postures, and using best practices and shared knowledge in
acquisitions. Cloud Smart is about equipping agencies with the tools and
knowledge they need to make these decisions for themselves, rather than
a one-size-fits-all approach.

By leveraging modern technologies and practices, agencies will be able
to harness new capabilities and expand existing abilities to enable
their mission and deliver services to the public faster. To make this
shift, instead of "buy before build", agencies will need to move to
"solve before buy," addressing their service needs, fundamental
requirements, and gaps in processes and skillsets before starting on a
new procurement. By rationalizing their application portfolios
regularly, agencies can continue to make modernization progress while
targets move with the ever-changing technology landscape.

Since the release of the original draft of this strategy, OMB has worked
with its partners -- both Government agencies and in the private sector -
to update policy guidance and create new resources for aiding cloud
adoption. Yet there will always be more work to be done, as technology
does not have a finish line. Embracing change as a core business
principle is critical to delivering the best return on investment to the
American people.

Sincerely,

Suzette Kent

U.S. Federal Chief Information Officer
